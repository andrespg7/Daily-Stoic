-When we are upset why our mind can justify every reason to be upset but when we are calm our mind ignore those same reasons?-

I think that selfishness play an important part in those moments because clearly we are looking justifications for what we feel and for what we will do without have that responsability us of the consequences. Other thing that this say us is that don't have true control about of our emotions and we need to work more in that.
